Random Generator

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This random generator was created as a practice project for ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and data fetching. Recently, jokes, quotes, and facts are available right now. I will add more features in the future.
